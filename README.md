##Setting up the Working space##
Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic + gazebo will be used and you will be guided on how to setup all that.

Part 1 : Installing Ubuntu
  Step 1: Install VMware
    1- Head to VMware Workstation player [Download Page](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-PLAYER-1701&productId=1377&rPId=100675)
    2- Continue installing VMware normally

    2-Open VMware -> Create new Virtual Machine 
    3- Choose the iso file you've downloaded in point 1, by pressing browse under Installer disk image file(iso)

    6- double click ubuntu 64-bit or click the green triangle to start the Virtual Machine

Part 2: Install ROS
  I've compiled all the nessasary steps into one simple script, all you have to do is copy it to your virtual machine and run it as such:
  1-Open Terminal (Ctrl+alt+T).
  2-Paste the following by pressing (Ctrl+Shift+V)
  
  and hit Enter.

Your workspace is now ready for simulation.
